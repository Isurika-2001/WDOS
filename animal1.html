                        <p>The Fishing Cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) which is endemic to South and Southeast Asia has been globally classified as an endangered species by IUCN in 2008. These feline beauties are larger than the domestic cat, being stout and strong with short legs and a smooth velvety coat that is olive-grey in colour with black long streaks running down the length of the body. They have a typical body length ranging between 25-4 inches, with males weighing around 12 kg and the females around 7 kg.</p>
                        <p>The Fishing Cat is nocturnal and moves about in the night looking for prey and feeds mainly on fish, reptiles, skinks, snakes, frogs and lizards and sometimes larger prey like dogs and calves. Being powerful swimmers they are most often found living close to wetlands, swamps, marshy lands, lakes and mangroves, and have been seen swimming long distances in search of aquatic prey.</p>
                        <p>Their bodies are covered with two layers of fur; a shorter layer of hair next to the skin that prevents water penetrating which helps keeps the animal warm, especially when swimming and a layer of longer hair that gives it the glossy, good looking sheen.</p><br>

                            <P>The fishing cat is a powerful, short-legged, mid-sized felid with a relatively short and thick tail. Male species are bigger than the female. The body of the fishing cat is olive grey in colour with prominent black stripes that run along the top of the head and neck before changing to spots that appear in a longitudinal direction along the rest of the body extending to the legs. The underside of the body is spotted and white in colour. The head of the animal is relatively big and broad with two prominent black stripes on each cheek. The muzzle is somewhat elongated. Their eyes have greenish irises, and the ears are short and rounded, with black on the back and prominent white spots in the middle. The toes of the front feet are partly webbed.</P><br>

                            <h2>BIOLOGY</h2>
                            <p>They prey primarily on fish, but birds, insects, rodents, mollusks, reptiles and amphibians are also included in their diet in small amounts. However, they are capable of preying on large mammals as well and have been seen scavenging livestock carcasses.</p><br>

                            <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
                            <p>Fishing cats are strongly associated with wetlands. They are typically found in marshlands, mangroves, reed beds, overgrown tanks, streams and riverbanks. They can even be found in paddy fields where there are remnant forest patches nearby to provide refuge. Occasionally, these animals can be seen in suburban environments where they have access to shelter and food sources. Fishing cats are good swimmers and can cover long distances underwater.</p>
                            <p>Fishing cats have a broad but discontinuous distribution in South and Southeast Asia. In Sri Lanka, they are widespread in suitable habitats throughout the island except the Wanni and Jaffna in the Northern Province. Other habitat locations of these cats include the Thalangama wetlands, the Kotte marshes, the Nawala Canal Zone, the Bellanwila-Attidiya marsh complex, the Koggala lakeshore, Kumana mangroves, Wasgamuwa National Park, Pottuvil, Kantalai, and most riparian forests.</p><br>

                            <h2>Threats and Conservation</h2>
                            <p>Wetland destruction is the primary threat facing this species. Indiscriminate trapping, snaring, poisoning and road accidents are also taking a toll on the dwindling population. According to the 2008 IUCN assessment, the fishing cat population is decreasing globally. Currently, it is classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List, meaning that it is “facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild.” The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) lists the fishing cat on Appendix II, which mandates a permit for the international trading of this species. The fishing cat is protected nationally and has been included in Schedule II (mammals and reptiles that are strictly protected) in the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance.</p><br>
