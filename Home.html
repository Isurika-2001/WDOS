                            <h2>BEST TIME TO VISIT</h2>
                            <img id="HomeImg3" src="images/giraffe1.jpg" alt="seelion" srcset="images/giraffe1.jpg 1x, images/giraffe1-2-.jpg 2x, images/giraffe1-3.jpg 3x">
                            <p>The best time to visit the Dehiwala Zoo is in winter or the dry season when there is less to no rainfall in the country. The winter months from October to February have soothingly cold temperatures and no humidity in the air. This would fit perfectly for you to wander around the zoo and not feel uneasy unlike summer months with hot temperatures and high humidity levels.</p>
                            <p>However, in the day time, one should visit as early as the zoo opens as it is the least crowded time of the day and plus you will get to roam around comfortably without having to worry about the closing time.</p>       
                            <p>Lastly, although the closing time of the zoo is 06:00 PM, the entry for the visitors closes by 05:30 PM sharp. So do not visit if you are not reaching the zoo on time. Moreover, you wouldn’t be able to enjoy the zoo in half an hour, so plan early.</p>
