                        <p>The zoo consists of diverse indigenous as well as foreign wildlife including mammals, reptiles, Amphibians, birds, butterflies and fish, destined for a horrible and torturous time spent. Every year the zoo exchanges some of its animals with other zoos worldwide to enlarge the diversity of its animals and introduce new species of animals as well. Dehiwala Zoo always trying to introduce new members to their animal collection to expand it. In 2008, 3 month old seal has been brought to Sri Lanka from the Krefeld Zoo in Germany.[9] A green anaconda (Eunectes murinus) which was brought to Sri Lanka some five years ago along with a male of the species, has given birth to 23 baby anacondas in the Dehiwala Zoo in 2008, and 20 of them had survived.[10] This was a very rare occasion of giving birth while in captivity, especially in a relatively unfamiliar territory. The ongoing animal breeding program is helpful for increasing the population of some animal species in the zoo and it also important for conservation of the endangered species in the world</p>
